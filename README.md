# statesegmentation

The statesegmentation package contains the implementation of a a greedy search algorithm (GSBS) to
segment a timeseries into states with stable activity patterns.
     
You can find more information about the method here:

biorXiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.069989

The method has since been improved as described here:

The package can be installed using: pip install statesegmentation

An example use case can be found in the examples directory.
